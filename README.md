### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
### My name is Alexandra Astileanu, and I am a ... Fullstack Java Developer / Test Automation Nerd / Software Engineer with a Bachelor in Science
- Computer Science was and still is my first love, since I was in 9th grade and I learned Pseudocode, Pascal and C#
- In the first 5 years of my career ... I worked as a Java Quality Assurance Engineer, because I wanted to really understand what good software really is. I was fascinated by performance-driven fast-paced betting platform (Betfair), writing front-end regression tests for Mobile and Desktop websites and apps. After that, I took a deep dive into backend and integration testing of E-Commerce systems (Media-Markt Saturn).
- In the last 5 years ... as a Java Developer, I became interested in complex Java secure systems, used in the card Payments industry (FIS Worldpay) and Order Management tools (IBM Sterling), enterprise communication, DevOps and clean code.
- In the last year... as a Fullstack Engineer, I worked with Spring, React, Node, Nest, Prisma, Postgres and a bunch of technologies which all spell out, "less is more".
